Our Team is named after Jean Purdy to honour her hardwork and dedication in the Scientific Revolution of Fertility Treatments.
Jean Purdy was a British Nurse and the first person to recognise and study the early Human Embryo Blastocyte formation, which had a key role in the development of In vitro Fertilization treatment (IVF).Clearly Purdy was integral to IVF, but even today her name is rarely mentioned.
Our Team is a diverse community of students, researchers and professionals from all over the globe working together to hone our skills in Bioinformatics and Computational biology.

## The Task - Work Flow
**The Spreadsheet project**

1. Each team should create a GitHub Repository.
2. Add a comprehensive readme.md with essential information about the internship, the team, the contributors, pictures if possible using markdown.
3. Each team will work on a minimum of 5 different programming languages
4. For each person in a team, pick one of the 5 programming languages. Write a script that prints your name, your email, your slack username (with @) , your biostack in this order. The output for every team member should now be name, email, slack_username (with @) your biostack.
5. Push the script to the team's GitHub Repository.
6. Collaboratively as a team, develop a bash script that clones the git repo, and generates a CSV file from all the outputs of your team's scripts
7. Submit your team's GitHub link to only the bash script.
